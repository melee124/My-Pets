  </ul>
  <p>Magenta and Cody will eat anything.  Midget only likes human food.  His favorite is ham, although he can occasionally be convinced to eat wet food.</p>
  <p>Cody is 18, and Midget and Magenta are 12. They're all so old!</p>
  <p>Cody plays like a kitten, while Magenta and Midget sit around like slugs.</p>
